# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis
This project demonstrates a practical, business-focused data analysis solution addressing a common telecom industry challenge: customer churn. Using a real-world telecommunications dataset sourced from Kaggle, the analysis explores how churn varies across customer demographics, subscription characteristics, and service usage segments.

The project applies best practices in exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python, including data cleaning, customer segmentation, churn rate comparisons, correlation analysis, and distributional analysis. Key relationships and trends are communicated through clear visualisations such as heatmaps, histograms, and comparative plots.

Analytical findings are framed with business relevance in mind, highlighting high-risk and high-value customer segments and surfacing insights that could support customer retention strategies, targeted engagement, and service optimisation. This project reflects how data analysts translate raw customer data into actionable insights for decision-makers.

### Key Analytical Components
- Customer segmentation based on demographic and subscription attributes
- Comparative churn rate analysis across customer segments
- Correlation analysis to identify relationships between churn and customer features
- Distribution analysis to understand behavioural and usage patterns
- Visual storytelling using interpretable charts and summary tables

### Tools and Technologies
- Python
- pandas for data manipulation
- matplotlib and seaborn for data visualisation
- Jupyter Notebook for exploratory analysis

### Business Insights
- Certain customer segments exhibit significantly higher churn rates, indicating opportunities for targeted retention efforts.
- Customers on specific contract types and service bundles show stronger loyalty patterns.
- High-value customer groups can be identified through a combination of tenure and subscription characteristics.
- These insights could inform proactive churn prevention strategies and personalised customer engagement.
